# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction — End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a reproducible, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting student academic performance using a multiclass classification approach. The system is designed with production-style engineering practices, focusing not only on prediction accuracy but also on clean architecture, reproducibility, and controlled experimentation.

Unlike notebook-based or one-off implementations, this project treats machine learning as a complete system, covering the full lifecycle from raw data ingestion to evaluation, reporting, logging, and automated testing.

---

## Key Objectives

- Predict student academic performance categories (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
- Compare multiple machine learning algorithms under identical experimental conditions
- Ensure reproducibility through configuration-driven execution
- Demonstrate industry-aligned ML engineering practices suitable for a capstone project

---

## System Highlights

- End-to-end pipeline: ingestion → validation → feature engineering → training → evaluation → reporting
- Fully config-driven using YAML files
- Reproducible experiments with deterministic outputs
- Clear separation of concerns across pipeline stages
- Automated metric generation and visualization
- Structured logging for traceability and debugging
- Automated tests for core pipeline contracts

---

## Algorithms Used

The following algorithms are trained and evaluated on the same dataset split and preprocessing pipeline:

1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree  
3. Random Forest  
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
5. XGBoost  

Performance is compared using accuracy, confusion matrices, and macro-averaged metrics.

## Dataset

- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Student Performance Dataset
- Format: CSV (semicolon-separated)
- Target Construction:
  - Final numeric score (G3) is deterministically mapped to:
    - LOW
    - MEDIUM
    - HIGH

The raw dataset is never modified. All transformations are performed programmatically within the pipeline.

---

## How to Run the Pipeline

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- pip

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn pytest
````

### Run full pipeline

```bash
python main.py run --config configs/experiment.yaml
```

### Run tests

```bash
pytest
```

---

## Outputs

After successful execution, the pipeline generates:

* Trained models (`artifacts/models/`)
* Evaluation metrics (`artifacts/metrics/metrics_summary.csv`)
* Confusion matrices and accuracy comparison plots (`artifacts/plots/`)
* Execution logs (`artifacts/logs/pipeline.log`)

All outputs are reproducible and can be regenerated by rerunning the pipeline.

---

## Design Philosophy

This project intentionally avoids:

* Jupyter notebooks in the final system
* Hardcoded parameters and paths
* Manual data manipulation

Instead, it emphasizes:

* Reproducibility
* Traceability
* Modularity
* Fair and controlled model comparison
